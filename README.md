# The Ultimate Dice-Game
This game was developed as my first coding project during my 6th week of the 15 week Per Scholas Software Engineering program. As I have always had a love for casinos and gambling, it felt natural when we were tasked with developing our own game that I would develop one of my favorite casino games, Craps. I developed this Craps Game with no tutorial and having not even looked at aa similar example online (which i regret doing). With slight help from my instructors, I was able to put together a fully functioning, simplified version of casino craps and I had a great time doing so as well.

### Basic Rules/How to Play Craps

According to @ [Syncuan Casino](https://www.sycuan.com/blog/how-to-play-craps-for-beginners/)

The game of craps has many exciting aspects to it. The concept of playing craps is to roll a number (a point) with two dice and then roll that same number again before a seven is rolled. The person at the craps table that rolls the dice is called “the shooter.”

When there is a number marked by the “pucks,” it means that the number is the “point” of the game. This is the number that the shooter is trying to make before seven rolls.

If the point is made, the puck is turned “off” and the shooter shoots again. It is now a “come out roll.” A “come out roll” means that it is the beginning of the game and there in no point established.

If the next number that rolls is a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10, then that is the point of the game. The shooter again tries to shoot the point before seven. If seven rolls before the point, we call that a “seven out.” The shooter loses control of the dice and we give the dice to the next shooter.

A new shooter makes a point and then tries to make the point before a seven, just as the previous shooter.



###Betting in Craps & Craps Strategy

According to @ [Syncuan Casino](https://www.sycuan.com/blog/how-to-play-craps-for-beginners/)

Pass Line Bet: Players are betting that on the first roll 7 or 11 rolls to win, 2, 3, or 12 loses. If a number such as: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 rolls, the number must repeat before a seven to win.

Field Bet: If any of the numbers that are in the field box come out, player wins. A field bet can also be referred to as a “ONE ROLL BET.”

Any 7 Bet: If the number 7 comes out, player wins. An Any 7 bet can also be referred to as a “ONE ROLL BET.”

Any Craps Bet: If any of the numbers 2,3, or 12 come out, player wins. An Any Craps bet can also be referred to as a “ONE ROLL BET.”
