# Dice-Game
This game was developed as my first coding project during my 6th week of the 15 week Per Scholas Software Engineering program. As I have always had a love for casinos and gambling, it felt natural when we were tasked with developing our own game that I would develop one of my favorite casino games, Craps. I developed this Craps Game with no tutorial and having not even looked at aa similar example online (which i regret doing). With slight help from my instructors, I was able to put together a fully functioning, simplified version of casino craps and I had a great time doing so as well.
